QUESTION 1
Software engineering is an organized, methodical, and measurable approach to creating, operating, and maintaining software. It involves a diverse set of activities, techniques, and tools designed to produce software systems that are high-quality, dependable, and easy to maintain.
**Key Differences**
The scope of software engineering is broad, encompassing the entire software development lifecycle—from gathering initial requirements to ongoing maintenance. In contrast, traditional programming is more narrowly focused on the tasks of writing and debugging code.
In terms of methodology, software engineering employs systematic approaches and best practices to manage complexity and ensure quality. Traditional programming, however, is often more immediate and task-oriented, addressing problems as they arise.
When it comes to documentation and processes, software engineering places a strong emphasis on thorough documentation, formal methods, and structured processes to understand, maintain, and scale software. Traditional programming may not require such detailed documentation.
Team collaboration is another area where these two approaches differ. Software engineering typically involves large teams working on various aspects of a project, necessitating significant coordination. Traditional programming can often be carried out by individuals or small teams with minimal need for extensive coordination.
Project management in software engineering includes detailed planning of timelines, allocation of resources, and management of risks. Traditional programming generally does not involve these project management aspects.
Lastly, quality assurance is a critical component of software engineering, involving systematic testing and quality assurance practices. While traditional programming does include testing, it is usually not as formalized or comprehensive.


QUESTION 2
1. Planning
In the planning phase, the project's scope and objectives are defined. This stage includes conducting feasibility studies to evaluate technical, operational, and economic factors. Resources, timelines, and budgets are also determined to create a clear roadmap for executing the project.

2. Requirements Analysis
During this phase, detailed requirements for the software are collected from stakeholders. This involves understanding user needs, business processes, and system functionality. These requirements are documented in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, which acts as a guide for subsequent phases.

3. Design
The design phase converts the requirements into a detailed blueprint for the software system. This includes defining the overall architecture, database design, user interfaces, and other components. The design document produced in this phase directs the implementation process.

4. Implementation (Coding)
In the implementation phase, developers write the actual code for the software based on the design specifications. This is where the software's functionality is built, typically in modular segments to facilitate easier testing and maintenance.

5. Testing
The testing phase involves ensuring the software meets the specified requirements and is free from defects. Various levels of testing, such as unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT), are performed to confirm the software's reliability and proper performance.

6. Deployment
During the deployment phase, the software is released to users. This can involve installation, configuration, and setting up the necessary environment for the software to function. Deployment can be done in a single release or in multiple stages, depending on the project.

7. Maintenance
The maintenance phase starts once the software is in use. It includes ongoing support to fix any issues, update the software to meet evolving requirements, and enhance performance. This phase ensures the software continues to operate correctly and remains useful over time.


QUESTION 3
Agile Model
